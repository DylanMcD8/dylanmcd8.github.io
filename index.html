<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Dylan McDonald. I moved to RIT from South Carolina, though I have lived many places. I lived in Maryland, then St. Thomas in the USVI, then Maryland again, then South Carolina, and now here. I now consider my non-RIT residence to be Maryland again though, as my parents moved back to St. Thomas.</p>

<p>I attended a private high school in South Carolina. My main hobby is creating my own applications in Swift. I enjoy both coding the apps and designing their interfaces.</p>

<h1>Favorite Food</h1>

<p>I'm not sure what my true favorite food is, but a meal I really like is the Crispy Honey Chicken from P.F. Chang's.</p>
